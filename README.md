# SPA_project

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p> Make an SPA using javascript without using promises and only using callbacks.</p>
<p> So I could train how to use callbacks and better understand how they function.</p>

<h2>My Project</h2>
<p> I used a public REST API that served me a json with news about an Online Game. </p>
<p> I show the banners in the main page and the specific news when clicked on it.</p>>
