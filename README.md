# SPA_project (on going)

##Challenge
<p> Make an SPA using javascript without using promises and only using callbacks.</p>
<p> So I could train how to use callbacks and better understand how they function</p>

##My Project
<p> I used a public REST API that served me a json with news about an Online Game </p>
<p> I show the banners in the main page and the specific news when clicked on it</p>

##To do
<p> Finishing implementation of the view that shows the info of the specific news </p>
